# YoutubeDataAnalysis
 YouTube dataset contains 4000 records which provides the information of YouTube channels, subsribers, upload, yearly earnings.
## Distribution of channel type
In this code, We have created a histogram for channeltype for 1000 records to see which is on the trend using matplot and pandas. As a result, it is clear that Entertainment sector is at the first place watched by majority of people whereas Nonprofit and Travel sector is preferred least.
## CSV File for 1000 Records
Here, using pandas we have exported the only the first 1000 records into a separate csv file out of original 4000 reords by assigning the output file name and the location.
